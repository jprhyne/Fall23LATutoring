# Sections and ideas in bin3

Note: This bin is really used by other bins very often. So the problems here are ones that are only bin3 and due
to this, there aren't very many I am classifying this way. However, if you have been following along the other
3 bins, you are almost definitely good on this one!

* Classes of Operators and Matrices Axler 7-9
    * Self-adjoint
    * Hermitian
    * Symmetric
    * Normal
    * Unitary
    * Positive Definite
    * Isometry
    * Nilpotent
    * Spectral Theorem
