in a way most compatible with Bin 4

\section{Prelim Problems}
\begin{questions}
    \question Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $\F$. Suppose $T\in \mathcal{L}(V)$ has minimal polynomial
    $p(z) = 3 + 2z - z^2 + 5z^3 + z^4$
    \begin{parts}
        \part[5] Prove $T$ is invertible
        \begin{solution}
            asdf
        \end{solution}
        \part[15] Find the minimal polynomial of $T$.
    \end{parts}
    \question Answer the following
    \begin{parts}
        \part Is there an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with $A^{n-1}\neq 0$ and $A^n = 0$? Give an example to show such a matrix exists (and explain why it satisfies both conditions), or disprove it.
        \part Show that an $n\times n$ upper triangular matrix with $A^n\neq 0$ and $A^{n+1} = 0$ does not exist.
    \end{parts}
    \question Let $T$ be a linear map on a vector space $V$ and $\dim V=n$
    \begin{parts}
        \part If for some vector $v$, the vectors $v$, $Tv$, \dots, $T^{n-1}v$ are linearly independent, show that
        every eigenvalue of $T$ has only one corresponding eigenvector up to a scalar multiplication
        \part If $T$ has $n$ distinct eigenvalues and vector $u$ is a sum of $n$ eigenvectors, corresponding
        to the distinct eigenvalues, show that $u$, $Tu$, \dots, $T^{n-1}u$ are linearly independent (and thus
        form a basis of $V$).
    \end{parts}
    \question Let $A\in\mathcal{M}_n\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ and $\lambda$ be an eigenvalue of $A$.
    \begin{parts}
        \part Show that $\lambda^r$ is an eigenvalue of $A^r$ for $r\in\mathbb{N}$.
        \part Provide an example showing that the multiplicity of $\lambda^r$ as an eigenvalue of $A^r$ may be 
        strictly higher than the multiplicity of $\lambda$ as an eigenvalue of $A$
        \part Show that $A^\top$ has the same eigenvalues as $A$.
        \part Show that if $A$ is orthogonal, then $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $A$.
    \end{parts}
\end{questions}

\section{Axler Problems}
\begin{questions}
    \question Suppose $V$ is an inner product space and $T\in\L{V}$ is normal. Prove that the minimal polynomial
    of $T$ has no repeated zeros
\end{questions}

\section{Other Problems}
These are from the Berkely Problems pdf.
\begin{questions}
    \question (7.5.16) Let $A$ and $B$ denote real $n\times n$ symmetric matrices such that $AB=BA$.
    Prove that $A$ and $B$ share a common eigenvector in $\R^n$.
\end{questions}
